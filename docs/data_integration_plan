# Data Integration Plan

## Objective
To merge the `student_performance` and `student_dropout` datasets into a unified dataset for analysis, while addressing schema discrepancies.

## Common Keys
- `student_id`: Unique identifier for each student.
- `gender`: A categorical variable available in both datasets.

## Challenges and Resolutions
1. **Data Type Mismatches**:
   - Convert all `student_id` columns to string type to ensure compatibility.
   
2. **Naming Inconsistencies**:
   - Standardize column names (e.g., `StudentID` vs `student_id`).

3. **Missing Values**:
   - Handle missing values during merging using an appropriate strategy (e.g., fill with "Unknown" or drop).

4. **Integration Approach**:
   - Perform an **inner join** on `student_id` to retain records present in both datasets.
   - Additional columns from the `student_dropout` dataset will be appended to the corresponding rows in the `student_performance` dataset.

## Output
The integrated dataset will be stored in `data/integrated/student_data_combined.csv`.
