# Project Plan 
Final Project for IS 477 by team jojo â€” "jo"celyn and jian "jo."

## Overview 
**more details** 
We will be aiming to answer our research question to the best of our ability based on our datasets using tools that we have been taught in class. Specifically, we want to answer our question of if there are gender-specific predictors of academic success and dropouts as well as what factors (study time, parental influence, extracurricular activities, etc...) differ between genders in relation to academic outcomes.

## Research Question 
We will conduct an analysis on gender differences in success and retention predictors. Our research question is **"Are there gender-specific predictors of academic success and dropout? How do factors like study time, parental influence, and extracurricular involvement differ between genders in relation to academic outcomes?"**

We want to look at the two datasets (one looking at student performance and the other looking at student dropout and academic success) and we want to see if these two datasets can make any significant statistical result for the gender-specific predictors of academic success and dropouts. 
Gender
Both datasets include a variable for gender (e.g., "sex" in Student Performance and "gender" in Predict Students' Dropout).
We want to see if there are similar factors influencing both datasets and if maybe one factor in one dataset seems to be heavily correlated with another factor in the other dataset. We also want to take a look and see if there are any significant or huge difference between the academic success of genders and if factors like study time, parental influence, and extracurricular activities differ between genders. It is intersting because although gender is not supposed to affect much outwardly, these factors will tell us if there is actually a pattern leading to a change in academic success whether you are a girl or a boy. 

## Team 
we're planning to work on the project in person together, meaning that the workload will be fairly distributed among the two of us. 

- Jian Jo: focus on data analysis more
- Jocelyn Yang: focus on writing down the findings on the report paper more
  
## Datasets 
This project requires two datasets from APIs: one for the higher education and the other for the secondary education. 
- higher education: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance 
- secondary education: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success 

Both datasets include a variable for gender (e.g., "sex" in Student Performance and "gender" in Predict Students' Dropout). Therefore, we will perform integration and data preprocessing 
## Timeline 
**it has to look like the actual timeline with the weekly plan etc** 
**make more detailed plans** 
- Acquire datasets from at least two souces (Jian & Jocelyn)
- Automatic (programmatic) integration of datasets using Python/Pandas and/or SQL (Jian)
- Transparent data profiling, quality assessment, and cleaning (Jocelyn)
- Implement simple data analysis and/or visualization (Jian)
- Create a reproducible package (Jocelyn)
- Automated end-to-end workflow execution (Jocelyn)
- Accurate citation of data and software used (Jian)
- Create metadata describing your package (Jocelyn)
- Archive your project in a repository, obtaining a persistent identifier (Jian)

1. Week 10: Oct 27 - Nov 2 
+ make a solid plan for this final project until the week 16
...decide two datasets and a research question for this project
+ acquire the two datasets programmatically with integrity checks (checksums); if not, write down detailed steps to acquire data on ProjectPlan.md file under the datasets section, ensuring it's reproducible. 

2. Week 11: Nov 3 - Nov 9
3. Week 12: Nov 10 - Nov 16 
**status report submission on nov 15** 

4. Week 13: Nov 17 - Nov 23 
5. Week 14: Nov 24 - Nov 30 (thanksgiving break)
6. Week 15: Dec 1 - Dec 7
